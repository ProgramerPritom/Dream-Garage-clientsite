                <p>We may have positive or negative impact on material purchasing, like if we replace the existing raw materials (which are responsible for co2 emissions during production in automotive industry) with a renewable raw material(like wood) which is also an eco friendly one. How this approach can affect the process of material purchasing in automotive industry.</p>

            <p>Is 60%/40% a typical fiber-matrix ratio in vehicle GFRP/CFRP composites?</p>
            </div>
            <div class="collapse-content"> 
                <p>Quick question I couldn't easily find a definite answer, so I hope someone here could help. I've been looking for information about the ratio (by weight) of glass or carbon fiber to epoxy matrix in composites that are used in automotive applications. The info I've found suggests that 60% fibre/40% epoxy matrix seems to be common for glass fibre reinforced plastics (GFRP), but does this apply in automotive applications, and is it representative for carbon fibre reinforced plastics (CFRP) as well?</p>
